Big Data Tools for Analysis
Big Data is a term applied to data sets whose size is beyond the ability of commonly used software tools to capture, manage, and process within a tolerable elapsed time. Big data tools have been evolved to the application of analytic techniques to very large, diverse data sets that often include varied data types and streaming data, i.e., parallel computing, MapReduce, NoSQL, etc. This class will discuss big data tools, analysis and use cases.
