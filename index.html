      <h2>What is Docker?</h2>
      <p>Docker is an open source tool that makes it easier to create run and deploy applications. It can do this because of containers; a container allows a developer to package all of the parts needed by the application into one package that can be run on any Linux machine. Since the application is being run on the home Linux kernel there is no need for Docker to create a whole new virtual operating system. This can reduce the size and increase the performance of the application.</p>

      <h2>What is Nginx?</h2>
      <p>NGINX is high performance, scalable, open source software for web hosting, reverse proxying, and media streaming. The NGINX architecture is highly scalable and has therefore become the de-facto standard for high performance websites such as Netflix, Airbnb, Tumblr, and Wordpress.com. By using a modular architecture that uses all of the underlying power of modern operating systems it can optimize the usage of memory and more importantly CPU power to get the most out of a server.</p>

      <h2>What is VM (virtual machine)?</h2>
      <p>A virtual machine (VM) is an emulation of a computer system that allows you to run an operating system (OS) or application environment within your computerâ€™s OS. It creates a computer within a computer. Additionally, the software within a virtual machine can not affect the computer; making it an ideal environment for software testing and development.</p>

      <h2>Who is Cloud Computing Service Provider - Digitalocean?</h2>
      <p>DigitalOcean is a simple and robust cloud computing platform founded in 2011 and designed to help developers deploy and scale applications. Their mission is to simplify cloud computing so that developers can focus on building world-changing software. The two main components of their cloud-computing platform are the virtual servers (Droplets) and the object storage (Spaces) but they also provide many other cloud-based tools. Developers can choose the size of their Droplets and change them at any time, resulting in a flexible and economical service which starts at only $5 a month. DigitalOceans main competitors are AWS, Google and Microsoft. </p>
