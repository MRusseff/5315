      <h2>What is GIT? Why do we need source code Version Control System?</h2>
      <p>Git is an open source version control system. A version control system acts as a medium between a local and a remote repository; allowing developers to push current changes, pull previous versions and compare program versions through simple commands. We need source version control systems because they enable developers to record changes to a file or set of files over time and keep track of workflow. This is especially important for debugging; it allows a specific version of a file to be recalled so that the bug or error can be easily identified. Additionally, if changes prove to be inefficient or just garbage you can revert back to a previous version that worked better. Source version control is also an important tool for collaboration, it allows for multiple teammates to work on any file at any time and then all of the changes will be merged to a common version—enabling more efficient team workflow. Lastly, using a version control system like Git with a team also means that there are multiple copies of the repository stored on all of the teammates disks which can act as a backup against losing everything in a server failure. </p>

      <h2>Describe following terms: 1) local repo 2) remote repo 3) how to use GIT in Team Project – multiple developers work on the same project at the same time</h2>
      <p>The local repository is stored locally on a physical computer and contains all of the remote repository’s history. Each team member has their own local repository on their computer where most of the code changes, staging, and committing occurs and once the changes are made they are then pushed on to the remote repository in order to be shared with the team. Once changes are merged on the remote, team members can then pull the new version back to their local repository. The remote repository is the centralized server that is being used to share data with your teammates. The remote repository is not on any team members physical computer but is accessible by all members of the team.  Working on a version control system like Git for a team project enables all the team members to work on any file at any time without impacting the work of others. Each team member starts by cloning the remote repository which will create their own local repository. They can work an any file and then stage and commit those changes to their local repository. Once committed to their local repo, they can push their changes to the remote where it will be merged with other changes made by other members of the team. Once the changes are merged and the remote repo is up to date, team members can pull the new versions to their local repos and start the process again. This kind of workflow helps developers work more effectively as a team, especially on larger scale projects where many pieces need to worked on simultaneously. </p>
